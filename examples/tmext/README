need:	Tcl, POSIX

A multi-package Tcl Module extension.
Each package adds a subcommand to the main ensemble.

Problem with this approach:
The tm path cannot be set to the main package and
the subpackages because the subpackages are in child
directories of the main package and that is not
permitted by the tm mechanism.
This makes it impossible to work from a subpackage
directory; a developer would have to work from
a configure/build directory for the entire package.
This would not be a problem if the subpackages
did not depend on the main package ie. the main
package has no code and simply serves to collect
the individual packages.

This package should build easily on any POSIX system.

This package uses Spot o' Conf to configure and build.

By default, this package will be configured to build
threaded for Tcl 8.6 (threaded) on OpenBSD.
